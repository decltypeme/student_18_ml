## About

This is a repository for creating a confidentiality-preserving machine learning pipeline via auditable secret sharing.

## Vanilla Pipeline

The Vanilla pipeline is a simple application of the [CALYPSO framework](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/tree/master/calypso) for auditable secret sharing.

### Dependencies

1. [Tensorflow for Go](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_go) and verify it is working.
2. [CALYPSO Service](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/tree/master/calypso)

## Data

For benchmarking and simulations we use the [Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra). For more information, please refer to [`data/`](data/README.md)
