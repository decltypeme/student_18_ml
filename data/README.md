For testing the machine learning pipeline we set-up experiment(s) using the [Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra) that is downloadable from UCI's [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

"This dataset is publicly available for research. The details are described in [Patricio, 2018]"
